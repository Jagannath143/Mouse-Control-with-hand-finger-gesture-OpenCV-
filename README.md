# Mouse-Control-with-hand-finger-gesture-OpenCV

In this repo i will show you how to control mouse with finger(index) gesture.
I use OpenCV for gesture analyzing , i use some color strip , pink color is used for controling the position , yellow color is used for left click and blue color is used for right click.

I placed pink color strip in my Proximal Phalanx area.
Placed yellow color strip in my Distal Phalanx area , it can be used for dragging.
Placed blue color strip behind my Middle Phalanx area.

So now , Let's play Snooker 147 and then chess and then perform cut,copy,paste operations on a file/folder by dragging.
