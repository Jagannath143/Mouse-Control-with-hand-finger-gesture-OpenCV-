I have created a project in which I have opearted mouse with finger gesture.
I have used OpenCV for gesture analyzing, some color strips for recognizing operations to be performed.
Pink color have been used for controling the mouse position, yellow color for left click and blue color for right click.

I have placed pink colored strip in my Proximal Phalanx area, yellow colored strip in my Distal Phalanx area, blue colored strip behind my Middle Phalanx area.

Let's play Snooker 147 and then chess and then perform cut, copy, paste operations on a file/folder by dragging.

Strips on my finger :
